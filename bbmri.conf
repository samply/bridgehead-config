### A note on Secrets:
### 
### Variable with a value of <VAULT> will be fetched from a central component
### upon each bridgehead startup.
### Using the proven Vaultwarden password manager puts you in full control of
### who can read the passwords. In particular, as long as you don't declare a
### secret as shared ("SITE+DKFZ"), DKFZ cannot read these strings.
### We recommend putting credentials such as local passwords into the password 
### store, not the git repo. Please keep your master password safe (vault.conf).
